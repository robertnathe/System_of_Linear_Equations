CSR Optimized Sparse Matrix Operations

This project provides a C++ implementation of high-performance sparse matrix operations using the 
Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. It supports matrix scaling, matrix-vector multiplication 
(SpMV), and Matrix Market (MM) file I/O for interoperability with scientific datasets.

Overview

Sparse matrices often appear in scientific computing, graph analysis, and machine learning. 
Representing them efficiently can save large amounts of memory and computation time. This program 
uses the CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) storage format to efficiently handle sparse matrix operations.

The program:
Reads a sparse matrix (`A.mtx`) and a vector (`B.mtx`) in Matrix Market format.  
Scales all non-zero entries of the matrix by a factor (default: 2.0).  
Computes the matrix-vector product \( X = A \times B \).  
Writes the resulting matrix and vector to disk in MM format (`output.mtx`, `X.mtx`).

Files and Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `main.cpp` | Main source code implementing CSR matrix operations and I/O. |
| `A.mtx` | Example Matrix Market input matrix (user-provided). |
| `B.mtx` | Example Matrix Market input vector (user-provided). |
| `output.mtx` | Output matrix (after scaling). |
| `X.mtx` | Output vector (result of matrix-vector multiplication). |

Key Components

1. Vector Class
A lightweight wrapper over `std::vector<T>` providing:
Resizing and indexing operations.
Stream output for quick display.
Used for storing both dense and result vectors.

2. Matrix Class (CSR Implementation)
Efficient sparse matrix representation using:
`values`: Non-zero matrix entries.
`col_indices`: Column indices of non-zero values.
`row_ptr`: Offsets indicating the start of each row in the compressed arrays.

Supported operations:
`buildFromTriplets(...)`: Constructs CSR format from coordinate form.
`scale(factor)`: Scales all non-zero elements.
`multiply(Vector<T>&)`: Performs sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

3. MatrixMarket Utility Class
Handles reading/writing matrices and vectors in Matrix Market (.mtx) format:
`readMatrix(filename)`: Reads sparse matrix.
`writeMatrix(filename, Matrix)`: Saves sparse matrix.
`readVector(filename)`: Reads vector.
`writeVector(filename, Vector)`: Saves vector.

Building and Running

Requirements
C++17 or newer
g++ or clang++ compiler

Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o csr_ops main.cpp
```

Execution
Ensure you have valid `A.mtx` and `B.mtx` files in Matrix Market format.

```bash
./csr_ops
```

The program will:
1. Read `A.mtx` (sparse matrix) and `B.mtx` (vector).  
2. Scale `A` by 2.  
3. Compute \( X = A \times B \).  
4. Write `output.mtx` (scaled matrix) and `X.mtx` (result vector).  
5. Print `X` to the console.

Example Matrix Market Inputs

Example `A.mtx`:
```
%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real general
3 3 4
1 1 10
1 3 20
2 2 30
3 1 40
```

Example `B.mtx`:
```
%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real general
3 1 3
1 1 1.0
2 1 2.0
3 1 3.0
```

Sample Output

Console:
```
Successfully processed CSR Matrix. Result Vector X:
70
60
80
```

Generated Files:
`output.mtx` — Scaled matrix (values × 2)
`X.mtx` — Computed result vector in Matrix Market format
